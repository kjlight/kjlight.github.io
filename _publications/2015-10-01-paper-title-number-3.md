We present a mode decomposition method for multicore fibers (MCFs) that is based on intensity measurements in the far-field. Mode decomposition of several homemade multicore fibers is demonstrated in the far-field with low residual errors. Accurate measurement of supermode compositions and of the electric fields among cores is crucial for many applications involving multicore fibers as well as their integration into multimode platforms.
