* _**Nonlinear interaction between counter-propagating light in multimode systems**_
  
  A new concept "mode rejection" was proposed with proof-of-concept experiments using multimode fibres and multicore fibres. By adjusting the boundary conditions applied to the multimode systems (where a spatial light modulator was used to precisely steer light into different fibre modes or fibre cores), several conceptual devices were demonstrated, including
