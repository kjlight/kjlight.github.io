Fibre optics/Free space optics
======
* _**Nonlinear interaction between counter-propagating light in multimode systems**_

  A new concept "mode rejection" was proposed with proof-of-concept experiments using multimode fibres and multicore fibres. By adjusting the boundary conditions applied to the multimode systems (where a spatial light modulator was used to precisely steer light into different fibre modes or fibre cores), several conceptual devices were demonstrated, including all-optically tunable mode switcher; all-optically tunable power splitter/combiner/switcher; all-optical remote phase detection.

Laser beam shaping
======
* _**Spatiotemporal shaping: Reconfigurable generation of high-peak-power, ps-pulsed laser beams with various spatial modes**_  

  Developed a multicore fibre amplifier for reconfigurable generation of high-peak-power, picosecond-pulsed beams with a variety of spatial modes: By using a spatial light modulator adaptively controlling the signal wavefront coupled into each fibre core, the output laser from a 6-core Yb-doped fibre was coherently combined into a stable and reconfigurable user-defined beam shape, including LP modes, optical vortex modes and vector modes.

* _**Spectral shaping: wavelength and mode conversion in multimode and multicore fibres**_

  Designed and tested multimode and multicore fibres for wideband wavelength and mode conversions, e.g., by optimising the multicore fibre design, broadband and tuneable parametric amplification was achieved by using a 1 Âµm pump in multicore fibres.
  
Laser beam characterization
======
* _**Laser mode decomposition**_

  Mode decomposition of multimode fibres/coupled-multicore fibres based on intensity measurements.
  
* _**Phase retrieval and laser beam quality measurement**_

  Characterisation of high-power fibre lasers via reconstructing complex amplitude by liquid lens and by implementing a proposed iterative phase retrieval algorithm.
