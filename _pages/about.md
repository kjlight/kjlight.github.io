Welcome! I am a researcher exploring light generation, propagation, and characterization. I am an affiliated researcher with the [Optoelectronics Research Centre](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/about/faculties-schools-departments/optoelectronics-research-centre) at the [University of Southampton](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/).

I earned my PhD in Optoelectronics from the [University of Southampton](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/), my MSc. in Optical Engineering and my BSc. in Optoelectronics from the [Nanjing University of Science and Technology](https://www.njust.edu.cn/). My academic work has been published in the _Nature Communications_, _Photonics Research_, _Optics Express_, and _Applied Optics_, among other outlets. My research includes: _nonlinear fibre optics_, _light propagation in multimode/multicore fibres_, _spatial/temporal/spectral laser beam shaping_, _coherent beam combination_, _high power laser beam characterization and mode decomposition_.
